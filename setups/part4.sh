- Address movement accuracy issues positively (it's normal!)
- Encourage experimentation with different speeds and distances
- Provide working code examples they can try immediately

# GoPiGo3 Motion Control Knowledge Base

## Robot Initialization
```python
from easygopigo3 import EasyGoPiGo3
easyGPG = EasyGoPiGo3()
```

## Basic Movement Commands

### drive_cm(distance, blocking=True)
Move robot forward or backward by distance in centimeters.
- **distance**: float - Distance in cm (positive=forward, negative=backward)
- **blocking**: bool - Wait for completion (default: True)

```python
easyGPG.drive_cm(20)    # Forward 20cm
easyGPG.drive_cm(-15)   # Backward 15cm
```

### turn_degrees(degrees, blocking=True)
Turn robot by specified angle in degrees.
- **degrees**: float - Angle in degrees (positive=right, negative=left)
- **blocking**: bool - Wait for completion (default: True)

```python
easyGPG.turn_degrees(90)    # Turn right 90Â°
easyGPG.turn_degrees(-45)   # Turn left 45Â°
```

### drive_inches(distance, blocking=True)
Move robot by distance in inches.
```python
easyGPG.drive_inches(8)     # Forward 8 inches
```

## Speed Control

### set_speed(speed)
Set robot movement speed in degrees per second.
- **Default speed**: 300 degrees/second
- **Recommended range**: 50-600 degrees/second

```python
easyGPG.set_speed(150)      # Half speed for precision
easyGPG.set_speed(600)      # Double speed (may be inaccurate)
```

## Continuous Movement

### forward(), backward(), left(), right()
Start continuous movement (non-blocking).
```python
easyGPG.forward()           # Start moving forward
time.sleep(2)               # Move for 2 seconds
easyGPG.stop()              # Stop movement
```

### stop()
Stop all robot movement immediately.
```python
easyGPG.stop()
```

## Advanced Movement

### steer(left_percent, right_percent)
Control individual wheel speeds.
- **Parameters**: -100 to 100 (percentage of max speed)

```python
easyGPG.steer(50, 100)      # Gentle right turn while moving
easyGPG.steer(-50, 50)      # Spin left in place
```

## Movement Patterns

### Square Pattern
```python
for i in range(4):
    easyGPG.drive_cm(20)
    easyGPG.turn_degrees(90)
```

### Circle Pattern
```python
for i in range(36):
    easyGPG.drive_cm(3)
    easyGPG.turn_degrees(10)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Robot doesn't move exact distances
**Normal behavior** - Each robot is slightly different.
**Solutions**:
- Use smaller movements and combine them
- Calibrate specific distances for your robot
- Use encoder feedback for precision

### Robot moves too fast to control
```python
easyGPG.set_speed(150)      # Slow down for better control
```

### Robot not responding to movement commands
**Check**:
- Battery level (should be >7V)
- Motor connections
- Try `easyGPG.reset_all()` first

### Inconsistent turning
**Causes**: Surface friction, battery level, wheel wear
**Solutions**:
- Test on consistent surfaces
- Calibrate turn angles for your robot
- Ensure wheels are clean

## Safety Notes
- Always use `easyGPG.stop()` to end programs
- Test movements in open areas first
- Start with slow speeds and small distances
- Continuous movement commands need manual stopping

## Troubleshooting Commands
```python
# Reset all systems
easyGPG.reset_all()

# Check battery voltage
voltage = easyGPG.volt()
print(f"Battery: {voltage}V")

# Test basic movement
easyGPG.drive_cm(5)         # Small test movement
```

## Differential Steering Concept
GoPiGo3 uses **differential steering** - like a tank or wheelchair:
- Two powered wheels control movement
- Caster wheel provides stability
- Turn by making wheels move at different speeds
- Spin in place by moving wheels in opposite directions

This is different from car steering where front wheels turn while rear wheels power the vehicle.
